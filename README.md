BLOG,

This is the HTML code for a blog post from Word press,
In this, I  have created the same frontend interface as that of that blog, with the same background and buttons
Now this does not have any backend and is only a frontend interface. Hence, it doesn't have any backup or real-timelike count.The main use of CSS for styling it to match with the design of that particular Blog post.


Using this code, u can create a frontend BLOG interface by just changing the contents in the code to your content.
