BLOG
This is the HTML code for a blog post from Word press,
In this i have created the same frontend interface as that of that blog, with the same background and like buttons
Now this does not have any backend and is only a frontend interface. Hence, it doesnt have any backup or real time like count.
Main use of CSS for styling it as to match with the design of that particular Blog post.


Using this code, u can creat a frontend BLOG interface by just changing the contents in the code to your content.
